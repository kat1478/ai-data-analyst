# AI Data Analyst

Professional summary

- AI Data Analyst is a compact, production-oriented tool that automates exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generates a clear, reproducible report. It is designed to demonstrate end-to-end data work suitable for technical screens and portfolio presentations.

Current status

- Phase 1 — Core analysis: Ready (CLI, Python only).
  - Loads CSVs
  - Detects types and missing values
  - Computes basic statistics
  - Flags simple data issues (high-missing columns, single-value columns)
  - Exports a readable report (report.txt)

Why this project

- Demonstrates practical data skills: data ingestion, cleaning, EDA, simple modeling, and reporting.
- Reproducible and easy to present to recruiters or technical interviewers.

Quick start (Phase 1)

1. Create and activate a Python environment (mamba/conda example):

```bash
mamba create -n ai-data python=3.10 -y
mamba activate ai-data
# or using conda:
# conda create -n ai-data python=3.10 -y
# conda activate ai-data
```

2. Install runtime dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or at minimum:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

3. Put your CSV into the `data/` folder (or let the script search recursively).

4. Run the analysis:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

5. Output

- report.txt (project root) — human-readable EDA summary.
- (Phase 2) charts in plots/ and richer report formats.

Tests

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```

Note on dataset (important)

- The synthetic dataset bundled with this project shows almost no linear relationship between features and Price (very low correlations and negative R² in baseline models). This repo is intended to demonstrate the analysis pipeline (EDA, preprocessing, feature inspection, simple modeling and evaluation), not to produce optimal predictive models for that synthetic data.

Technical stack (v1)

- Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn (for optional simple models)
- Report export to plain text (and Markdown/HTML in later phases)

Roadmap

- Phase 2: Visualizations, richer statistics, simple models, improved reporting.
- Phase 3: Lightweight web UI (Streamlit) with file upload and interactive results.
- Phase 4: Polished portfolio deliverable with README case study, screenshots and deployment notes.
